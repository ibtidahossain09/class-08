            <p>12-year-old earl Ciel Phantomhive lives in Victorian-era London. He acquired his title and position after the events of his tenth birthday on December 14, 1885, when the Phantomhive manor was attacked by unidentified perpetrators.</p>
            <aside>Earl Ciel Phantomhive's butler, Sebastian Michaelis informs him that Damian, the head of Funtom, Ciel's confectionery toy company,is coming.</aside>
            
            <div class="class1" mainclass>
                 <p>The man is Sebastian, hiding the lifeless body of Earl Ciel in his suitcase. Sebastian escapes; the tea box is revealed to contain Ciel's family heirloom ring. Sebastian places it on Ciel's finger and says it is time to wake up.</p>
                  <span id="span">Ciel and Sebastian celebrate the third anniversary of Funtom Company by hosting Hamlet as the play for an orphan charity. However, all the actors hired to perform in the play cannot arrive in town for another week due to a shipwreck. Since the play cannot be postponed, Sebastian is ordered by Ciel to make the play a success regardless. Sebastian rallies up the whole group together to be in the play, and they are visited by mostly every character in the series in this episode. Though the plot was ultimately altered, the play turns out, for the most part, a success.</span></div>
